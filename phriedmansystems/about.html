            Few know that Phriedman Systems began as a mere ceilometer manufacturer, branching off from our CEO's first business. Over time we diversified to obtain our vast portfolio of today's products and services. We moved down to the DMV in 2014 to better facilitate
            service for customers in the region. To hear all about our exciting corporate story, feel free to contact us and ask about company info.
